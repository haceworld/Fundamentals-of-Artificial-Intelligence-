# Fundamentals-of-Machine-Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) which focuses on the use of data and models to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy performance.

Machine Learning (ML) teaches a machine how to make inferences and decisions based on past experience. It identifies patterns, analyses past data to infer the meaning of these data points to reach a possible conclusion without having to involve human experience. This automation to reach conclusions by evaluating data, saves a human time for businesses and helps them make a better decision.

## How machine learning works
The learning system of a machine learning algorithm can be broken into three main parts.

### A Decision Process:
In general, machine learning algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification. Based on some input data, which can be labelled or unlabeled, your algorithm will produce an estimate about a pattern in the data.

### An Error Function:
An error function serves to evaluate the prediction of the model. If there are known examples, an error function can make a comparison to assess the accuracy of the model.

### A Model Optimization Process:
If the model can fit better to the data points in the training set, then weights are adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the known example and the model estimate. The algorithm will repeat this evaluate and optimize process, updating weights autonomously until a threshold of accuracy has been met.
